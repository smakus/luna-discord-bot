# Luna — Discord AI Voice Assistant

Responsibly Vibecoded with Claude.  If you find this fun, interesting, or valuable, [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/qgt11lbfad)!

Luna is a locally-hosted AI voice assistant for Discord. She listens for her wake word, transcribes speech using Whisper, generates responses via LM Studio, and speaks back using Kokoro TTS — all running on your own machine with no cloud AI dependencies.

## Features

- 🎤 Wake word detection — say "Luna" to activate (configurable)
- 🧠 Local LLM via LM Studio with conversation memory
- 🔊 Local TTS via Kokoro TTS with streaming audio output
- 🌐 Optional web search via Tavily MCP
- 👥 Multi-user support with per-user audio capture
- ⚡ Low-latency streaming pipeline — LLM response streams sentence-by-sentence directly into TTS, so Luna starts speaking before she's finished generating
- 🔁 Interruptible — say "Luna" at any time to cut her off and ask something new
- 🔇 Configurable ignored users (e.g. music bots)

---

## How It Works

Luna's audio pipeline is designed for low latency at every stage:

```
You speak
    ↓  (1000ms silence detection)
Whisper transcribes locally
    ↓  (wake word check)
LM Studio streams response tokens
    ↓  (sentence boundary detected)
Kokoro streams sentence 1 audio ──► Discord plays sentence 1
    ↓  (sentence 2 already being fetched in parallel)
Kokoro streams sentence 2 audio ──► Discord plays sentence 2
    ...
```

Key design decisions:
- **Sentence-chunked TTS**: the LLM response is split into sentences as tokens arrive. Each sentence is sent to Kokoro immediately — Luna starts speaking the first sentence while the LLM is still generating the rest.
- **Prefetch pipeline**: Kokoro begins generating sentence N+1 while sentence N is still playing, eliminating gaps between sentences.
- **Streaming audio**: Kokoro streams WAV chunks directly to Discord rather than buffering the full audio file first.
- **Interrupt on wake word**: audio capture runs continuously regardless of whether Luna is speaking. A new wake word immediately stops the current response and starts a fresh one.

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux
- A Discord bot token
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) with a loaded model (required regardless of install method)
- Docker (for the recommended install)
- **Optional but recommended**: A [Tavily](https://tavily.com) API key (free tier, for web search)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smakus/luna-discord-bot
cd luna-discord-bot
```

### 2. Docker Installation (recommended)

The repo includes a `Luna-Discord-Bot-Full-Docker/` directory with a Docker Compose setup that runs both Luna and the Kokoro TTS server together.

```bash
cd Luna-Discord-Bot-Full-Docker
docker compose up --build
```

This builds and starts two containers:
- **luna** — the Discord bot (Node.js)
- **kokoro** — the local TTS server (Python/FastAPI)

### 3. Set up LM Studio

1. Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
2. Download a model — recommended: **Qwen3.5 9B** or any instruction-tuned model that fits your RAM
3. Load the model and start the local server (green toggle in the Server tab)
4. Enable authentication in LM Studio settings and copy the bearer token
5. Enable MCP in LM Studio if you want web search (see `.env` setup below)

### 4. Create a Discord bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application and add a bot
3. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent
   - Voice States
4. Copy the bot token
5. Invite the bot to your server with these permissions:
   - Read Messages / View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Connect
   - Speak
   - Use Voice Activity

### 5. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in `Luna-Discord-Bot-Full-Docker/Luna/` (see `example.env`):

```env
# Discord
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token

# LM Studio — use host.docker.internal when running in Docker
LM_STUDIO_URL=http://host.docker.internal:1234/api/v1/chat
LM_STUDIO_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN=your_lm_studio_bearer_token

# Kokoro TTS — use the Docker service name when running in Docker Compose
KOKORO_URL=http://kokoro:8880/v1/audio/speech
KOKORO_VOICE=af_heart

# Tavily web search (optional)
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

# Comma-separated Discord user IDs to ignore (e.g. music bots)
IGNORED_USER_IDS=
```

> **Note:** If running outside Docker, replace `host.docker.internal` with `127.0.0.1` and `kokoro` with `localhost`.

**Available Kokoro voices:**

| Voice         | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `af_heart`    | American female (warm)       |
| `af_sarah`    | American female (clear)      |
| `af_bella`    | American female (expressive) |
| `af_sky`      | American female (bright)     |
| `bf_emma`     | British female               |
| `bf_isabella` | British female (formal)      |

### 6. Add a chime sound

Place a file named `chime.mp3` in the `Luna-Discord-Bot-Full-Docker/Luna/` directory. This plays when Luna is activated. Any short MP3 works — keep it under 2 seconds.

---

## Running Luna

1. Start LM Studio, load your model, and ensure the local server is running
2. From the `Luna-Discord-Bot-Full-Docker/` directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

3. Check logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f luna
docker compose logs -f kokoro
```

---

## Usage

1. Join a Discord voice channel
2. In any text channel, type `!luna`
3. Luna will join your voice channel
4. Say **"Luna"** followed by your question or command

**Examples:**

- *"Luna, what's the weather today?"* — triggers web search via Tavily
- *"Luna, tell me a joke"* — direct LLM response
- *"Luna, what did I just ask you?"* — uses conversation memory
- *"Luna, play song Bohemian Rhapsody"* — triggers music bot integration

**Interrupting Luna:**

You can say "Luna" at any point while she is speaking to interrupt her and ask a new question. She will stop immediately and respond to the new query.

---

## Tuning

The following constants at the top of `index.js` can be adjusted:

| Constant           | Default             | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `WAKE_WORDS`       | `['luna', 'loona']` | Wake word variants to listen for                     |
| `SILENCE_MS`       | `1000`              | ms of silence before processing utterance            |
| `ENERGY_THRESHOLD` | `300`               | Minimum audio energy level to count as speech        |
| `MIN_SPEECH_MS`    | `300`               | Minimum utterance length (ms) to bother transcribing |

**Tips:**
- If Luna triggers on background noise, **increase** `ENERGY_THRESHOLD`
- If Luna misses soft speech, **decrease** `ENERGY_THRESHOLD`
- If Luna cuts you off too early, **increase** `SILENCE_MS`
- If Luna feels sluggish to respond, **decrease** `SILENCE_MS`

---

## Troubleshooting

**Luna doesn't respond to the wake word**
Check Docker logs — you should see `[userId] Processing Xms utterance...` when you speak. If not, `ENERGY_THRESHOLD` may be too high. Try lowering it to `200`.

**Whisper returns empty transcripts**
Ensure the model file exists at the path set in `WHISPER_MODEL`. Test manually inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it luna-1 whisper-cli -m /opt/whisper/models/ggml-small.en.bin -f /tmp/test.wav
```

**Kokoro TTS not working**
Test the server directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello, I am Luna.", "stream": false}' \
  --output test.wav && afplay test.wav
```

**LM Studio not responding from Docker**
Ensure LM Studio's server is running and bound to `0.0.0.0` (not just `127.0.0.1`) so Docker can reach it via `host.docker.internal`. Test:
```bash
curl http://host.docker.internal:1234/api/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LM_STUDIO_MCP_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

**No audio in voice channel**
Make sure the bot has **Connect** and **Speak** permissions in your Discord server.

**Sentences with numbers sound split up**
This is handled automatically — the sentence splitter ignores periods inside decimal numbers (e.g. `$403.80` won't be split). If you see other edge cases, adjust the `SENTENCE_END` regex in `index.js`.

## Advanced — Red-DiscordBot Music Integration (VoiceBridge)

If you run [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) with the Audio cog in the same server, you can give Luna the ability to control music playback by saying *"Luna, play song [song name]"*.

### How it works

Luna detects the phrase "play song" in a query, extracts the song name, and posts `!play <song>` to the text channel. Because Discord bots ignore messages from other bots by default, a small Red cog called **VoiceBridge** bridges the gap — it whitelists Luna's user ID and relays the command to Red's Audio cog.

### Setup

**1. Get Luna's Discord user ID**

Right-click Luna in Discord (with Developer Mode enabled) and copy her user ID.

**2. Install the VoiceBridge cog**

Copy the `voicebridge/` folder into your Red-DiscordBot cogs directory:

```bash
cp -r voicebridge/ /path/to/redbot/cogs/voicebridge/
```

**3. Update the bot ID**

In `voicebridge.py`, replace `AI_BOT_ID` with Luna's actual Discord user ID:

```python
AI_BOT_ID = 123456789012345678  # Luna's Discord user ID
```

**4. Load the cog in Red**

```
[p]load voicebridge
```

**5. Usage**

Say: *"Luna, play song Bohemian Rhapsody"*

Luna will post `!play Bohemian Rhapsody` to the text channel, VoiceBridge intercepts it and invokes Red's Audio cog, and music starts playing.
